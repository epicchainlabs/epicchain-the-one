# Use the EON Token.

Now that we've launched our ICO, let's build a few contracts that make use of the EON token. We'll learn some advanced concepts in smart contract programming as well as reinforce what we've learned in previous lessons.

In this lesson we'll build a simple Escrow contract that allows one person to send EON to another person, but requires them to take action to claim the EON. If they don't claim the EON, the sender can reclaim their tokens.
