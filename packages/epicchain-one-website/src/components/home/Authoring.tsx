        Authoring smart contracts has never been easier. First class TypeScript integration means that smart contracts
        are strongly typed and will never leave you guessing at what's supported. Write idiomatic TypeScript with inline
        compiler diagnostics using the NEOâ€¢ONE TypeScript plugin.
