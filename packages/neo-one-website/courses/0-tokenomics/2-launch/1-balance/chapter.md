# Chapter 2: Fetch User Balance

In this chapter we'll take a quick look at how we can invoke constant methods using the NEOâ€¢ONE client APIs. This chapter will be rather short because, like properties, constant methods correspond one-to-one with methods on the generated client smart contract APIs.

## Learn

Let's jump right in with an example.

```typescript
import { constant, SmartContract } from '@neo-one/smart-contract';

export class Example extends SmartContract {
  @constant
  public myConstantMethod(myFirstArg: string): string {
    return myFirstArg;
  }
}
```

We can invoke `myConstantMethod` by simply calling it on the generated client APIs.

```typescript
const myResult = await example.myConstantMethod('foo');
expect(myResult).toEqual('foo');
```

Similar to the previous chapter, the only difference with the generated client APIs and what was defined in the smart contract is that they return a `Promise`, so we must `await` the result.

## Instructions

  1. Add a call to the `getTokenInfo` method which returns the balance of the argument address and add it to the result.

Note that you'll have to deal with the case where `address` is undefined - just return `new BigNumber(0)` as the balance. Also note the new type `AddressString`. Recall that in our smart contract, we declared a single parameter of type `Address` for the `balanceOf` method. `AddressString` is the 1:1 mapping in the generated client APIs which let us pass the NEO address in string form which will then be automatically converted into the proper form for the smart contract. Read more about the 1:1 type mappings in the [documentation](/docs/smart-contract-apis#type-conversion-table).

## Test

Notice we added a row for the balance of the current user in the dapp preview. Right now it will always show 0 since the current user (nor any other user) has participated in the ICO. Similarly, the tests add a check that the returned balance for the passed address is 0. Run the tests to verify you've implemented `getTokenInfo` correctly and then proceed to the next chapter.

## Wrap Up

In this chapter we saw that invoking constant methods is virtually identical to accessing properties. In the next chapter we'll look at invoking non-constant methods by implementing a text input for participating in the ICO.
