After a year of development, we are proud to announce the official release of NEO•ONE.

## What is NEO•ONE?

NEO•ONE is an end-to-end software development kit for building NEO decentralized applications using TypeScript or JavaScript. NEO•ONE was designed from the ground up to make coding, testing and deploying NEO dapps easy, fast, efficient and enjoyable. The complete framework offers effortless startup and empowers you with tooling every step of the way.

**Author idiomatic TypeScript smart contracts that look, feel and work just like a normal TypeScript program.**

**Write automated unit tests using familiar testing frameworks like Jest.**

**Use the intuitive client APIs to connect and interact with your smart contract on the blockchain, both in your decentralized application as well as your automated tests.**

**Invoke the NEO•ONE toolchain to setup a local private network, compile and deploy your smart contracts to that network, setup wallets with various NEO and GAS and generate testing utilities and client APIs for interacting with your smart contract - all in one command.**

**Leverage the NEO•ONE Developer Tools to simplify the process of developing and manually testing a dapp. Immediately run consensus, fast forward the blockchain to a future time, reset the local network to its initial state and use the full wallet implementation, directly from within your dapp during development.**

## Future

This release is just the start for NEO•ONE. We're working closely with the NEO Global Development to have a few features implemented in order to enable MainNet compatibility for NEO•ONE TypeScript smart contracts. We also have many projects in the pipeline to further improve the experience - integrated IDE debugger, smart contract patterns library, wallet integrations and more.

Try out NEO•ONE, give feedback and join us on the journey towards making NEO•ONE the most developer friendly framework in all of blockchain.
